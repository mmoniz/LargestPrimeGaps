Assignment 3
------------

Write an MPI program to try and find the largest gap between two prime numbers.

Example:
	11_13 = 2
	13_17 = 4
	31_33 = 2

mpz_prob_prime_p
mpz_nextprime
	P0		P1		P2		P3

a -|---g1---[--|--]-----g2---[--|--]----g3---[--|----]---g4---|- b

-pass the gap to the previous process (need to check if there are any primes)
-handle when each process has 0 primes in its range
